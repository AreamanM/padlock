# Padlock

An implementation of global media hotkeys for Spotify on Windows.

Dropping the executable in your startup folder(press win+r and type $shell:startup) is enough; Padlock does not have a gui and takes around 2-3 mb of ram at any given moment so it is very lightweight.

- ctrl-alt-{left,right} for prev/next song
- ctrl-alt-space for toggling play/pause
- ctrl-alt-{up,down} for increasing/decreasing volume by 5 points
